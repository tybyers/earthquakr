## A Note on Plagiarism

For my fellow Coursera students, please remember that using or "borrowing" this code in order to complete your own project is a violation of the Coursera Honor Code. In past courses in this specialization, I reported several individuals who clearly copied my work, which I noticed when I was grading their assignments.  I will not hesitate to do the same for this Capstone project.  

## Known Issues

  * Functions as currently written will produce Travis Notes and/or warnings due to using nonstandard evaluation instead of standard evaluation throughout the functions.  
  * The Vignette is in "draft" status, more robust documentation needed. 
  * Some of my examples in the documentation are producing errors when building the project.
