### A Note on Plagiarism

For my fellow Coursera students, please remember that using or "borrowing" this code in order to complete your own project is a violation of the Coursera Honor Code. In past courses in this specialization, I reported several individuals who clearly copied my work, which I noticed when I was grading their assignments.  I will not hesitate to do the same for this Capstone project.
